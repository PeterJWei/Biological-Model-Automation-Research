Model Design Automation Algorithms, by Peter Wei
These algorithms are designed to take in a table of molecular strengths and create logic functions from them.

To recompile the source files, type
gcc model.c -o model

And then run the executable by
./model <filename>

Currently, the filename must be a .csv file.
For example,
./model testfiles/Workbook1.csv
will run the testfiles/Workbook1.csv file through the algorithms, and create a file called testfiles/Workbook1.pla

testfiles/Workbook1.pla can then be run through espresso.
